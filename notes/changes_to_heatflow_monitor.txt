list of changes to Heatflow Monitor 9/17/21
---------------

-adjusted color on the status text window to be softer colors for ease of reading text messages.
-changed text of message for a incomplete line of data to be more human-readable & now includes the verbatim data line.
-fixed bug where, after printing a pdf, the main plot reverts to showing all the data glitches in the plots.
-changed the text of the menu entry from 'Export plot As...' to 'Export PDF plot As...' to make the function clearer.
-Fixed bug where data would append to a pre-existing output data file, if same filename is chosen,
instead of overwriting the file w/ fresh data.
-Fixed bug where if there was a file error on the output file, one would get file error.
messages every time a new line was written. Now one just gets a single error message dialog.
-Fixed a bug where the debug log configuration file wasn't defined properly and 
when the program was run from the command line 'java - jar heatflow_monitor.jar'
or by double-clicking on  it, the logger didn't work.
-Fixed HOPEFULLY all of the library problems where some functions fail out with Java errors
-Fixed colors of plots so they are readable on black and white backgrounds and colors are consistent with screen and printed versions
-Fixed names of probes in printed plots from generic names to the actual names of probes
