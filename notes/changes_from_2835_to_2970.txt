Changes from build 2835 to 2970
-------------------------------

Added a method for reading the data as it comes from the probe into a file.
This file can be selected from the user interface and the name of the file is saved
in the preferences file along with the sampling rate and the data directory.
A new file menu entry is introduced named 'Set the Data Input File'.

A new mode that sets the input data to be the synthetic file is introduced and
a new file entry is labeled 'Set Synthetic Data Mode to True'.
	A warning dialog is then displayed that one has to click through.
