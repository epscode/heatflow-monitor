Part of a much larger project to provide oceanographic heat flow measurements utilizing devices that provide heat pulses and a series of thermistors in order to characterize the thermal conductivity of the benthic strata. This program is to monitor the real-time telemetry from the thermistors by a probe operator. Monitoring includes depth, probe tilt, probe battery voltage, and temperature plots as well as raw temperature measurements on selected probes. See user guide for more information.
