       <h2 id="intro">I. Introduction and Purpose</h2>

			<p>This document describes desired functional specification for software that will receive
 and display data telemetered to an oceanographic vessel during operation of a 
 multi-penetration heat flow system that is in development by a team of OSU, WHOI, 
 and UCSC researchers and engineers.

			<p>Complete data collected by the seafloor heat flow system will be stored internally on a 
logger, recovered and processed when the system is returned to the ship. A subset of data 
will be telemetered using a SonarDyne system that is also used for ultra-short baseline 
(USBL) navigation. Received data will be parsed by a dedicated computer, separating 
navigation and heat flow data. The heat flow data will arrive by serial connection 
(we believe...detailed TBD). This document focuses on how we would like to display the 
heat flow data once it is received on a dedicated computer.

		<p>The overall approach is similar in some ways to that developed for the Alvin-style 
heat flow probe. However, the Alvin probe is operated with a cabled serial connection 
that allows two-way communication, probe control, and data transmission. 
For the OSU/OTIC heat flow system, communication is by acoustic modem and is 
probe-to-ship only. In principle we could have two- way communication and 
probe control as part of this system, but this would require a large power draw on the 
seafloor (supplied by batteries in a limited space) and would increase the complexity 
of operating software on the probe.

		<p>
The operating system for the OSU/OTIC heat flow logger is described in a separate 
document, which includes an explanation as to how the data stream to be telemetered 
from instrument to ship will be determined. The next section of this document describes 
data selection for telemetry, then focuses on how the data will be displayed and logged.

		<h2 id="telemetry">II. Data Telemetry</h2>

<p>The operator of the heat flow system will set a series of parameters in a file that is 
accessed by the data logger on start up. Once these are set, they can be changed only by 
restarting the heat flow probe with a different parameter file. Among the parameters set 
for probe operation are these related to the interval for data collection and telemetry, 
and what data are to be included in the telemetry stream.


		<p><b>Explanations</b>

		<p>- sps = n

		<p>Typical time interval for sample collection by the heat flow system will be 1 to 10 s, 
although longer sample intervals could be selected to save power, if desired. 

		<p>- tps = m 

		<p>This is a multiplier, determines the time interval for a subset of data to be sent to 
the USBL unit for telemetry. For example, if sps = 2, indicating 2-second sampling by the 
system, a value of tps = 10 would result in data sent from the logger to the USBL modem 
every 20 seconds (2 x 10). Data going to the telemetry unit will sit in buffer until the 
modem is "pinged" from surface and asked to send a location and data. The contents of this 
data buffer will be replaced each time new data is sent to the modem. Thus the modem will 
send whatever is the most recent dataset received from the logger, whether that was 1 
second earlier or 10 seconds earlier, etc. 

		<p>- This could result in an irregular data transmission interval if, for example, we ping 
for a probe position from the ship every 30 seconds, but send data to the modem from the 
probe every 20 seconds. To avoid this, it might be safest to set the ping interval from 
the surface to be an integer product of sps x tps. For example, we could have data 
logging to the file at 2 s (sps = 2), data sent to the USBL system at 10 s (tps = 5), 
then ping from the surface at 20 s. 

		<p>- The main considerations at present are (a) benefits of more frequent updates showing 
system performance versus (b) power requirements associated with more frequent data 
transmission. With excessively frequent data transmission, there might also be 
interference or loss of fidelity if there are echoes. All of this will need to be sorted 
once we know more about real-world system performance and power requirements. 

		<p>- tdls =...: Data set sent to modem for transmission to surface in near-real time. 
This should be a subset of data written to memory, using similar format.

		<p>Example: tlds = DateTime, V, tilt, P, TBW, T01, T08, T15, T22 

		<p>DateTime = date and time (format = YY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss,' ')
		<p>V = system voltage (f5.2,' ')
		<p>Tilt = angle from vertical, decimal degrees (f5.2,' ')
		<p>- The probe logger will measure and record three-component accelerometer data. For 
telemetry, probe will use vertical acceleration (AZ) to estimate tilt with a function 
like tilt = degrees(arccos(AZ/g)).
		<p>P = output of pressure gauge, converted to equivalent water depth in meters (f8.3,' ').
		<p>- Parameter set in heat probe configuration file will include conversion factor from 
pressure to depth = pressure/(rhow x g), where rhow = approximate water density 
(typically ~1040 kg/m3 for oceanic depths)
		<p>TBW = temperature of bottom water (f7.3,' ')
		<p>TXX to TYY = temperature values for four (4) selected sensors (f7.3,' ')
		<p>- The main probe system will record data from &GreaterEqual;11 sensors (most likely 17-18 for a 
3.5 m lance), but only four (4) values  will be telemetered, to aid in reading the real 
time record. 
		<p>- Final data value to be followed by CR/NL (or LF), as appropriate

		<p>Telemetry Data Storage
		<p>As noted earlier, telemetered data is intended mainly for assessment of system status 
during operation, and to make rough estimates of geothermal conditions that could 
influence subsequent measurements. However, it is possible that the telemetered data will 
be needed for quantitative assessment if the seafloor probe system is damaged. Therefore, 
it is desired that we store a complete record of the telemetered data stream, following 
the listing and format of data shown above. The name of the file used for shipboard 
storage of telemetered data can be set with a parameter file and/or when the real-time 
monitoring program is launched.

		<p>FYI, an additional parameter in the probe operating software will specify the name of 
a file that will log the data stream sent for telemetry in memory on the probe logger, 
with a default filename = logfileUSBL.raw. This datafile will be stored in the same 
directory/folder on the data logger as the complete data file. This "telemetry file" 
may be useful for verifying behavior of the telemetry components and software, after 
the full system is recovered at the end of a station. 

		<h2 id="display">III. Program Display Theory</h2>
		<p>The data display for the real time system is to be configured to show a variety 
of information. The display screen is divided into six "data windows," a "status window" 
to the left, a legend at the bottom and a drop-down menu at the top, as shown with this 
draft from 4/11/21 (additional features/function in development, discussed below):
